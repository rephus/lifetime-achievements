### Work in progress

## Description
Lifetime-achivements is a service powered by Slack that uses a bot to read and store
some specific phrases on a channel with a timestamp.

Later you (and any other slack member) will be able to see all your achievements in a calendar view
to remember all the things you have accomplished on your life.

E.g:

```
#lifetime-achievement channel
@rephus: > Created new project called lifetime-achievement
```

## How to run

```
npm install
node lifetime-achievements.js
```
